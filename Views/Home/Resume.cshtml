                                        I attended UCM's art education program for 2 years. Though life had other plans for me and I left before graduation, I have retained my love of art ever since. I try to bring my passion for creativity into all that I do, and let that fuel the projects that I take on both at home and in the workplace.

                                        In this position, I took on more responsibility by being mostly self-regulating. I unloaded freight weekly, and categorized all incoming products for ease of locating. I worked independently, managing inventory, setting up and designing store displays for holidays, and stocked incoming products. Within my team, I also helped with store remodels and assisted the manager by training new hires when necessary.
